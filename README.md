# Activity Space Project

This is the website for the Activity Space Project. The project aims to better understand human mobility at the scale of cities. By studying daily patterns of movement across a city, we can learn about access to resource and exposure to hazards. We can learn about barriers that lead to inequality and opportunities to improve peoples' lives.
